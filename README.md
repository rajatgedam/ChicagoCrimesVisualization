# ChicagoCrimes

This visualization project shows the crime trends between the years 2018 and 2023 in Chicago city. It uses D3.js library to implement the visualizations. 

Description:

A  visualization of the Chicago city and its community areas with bar graphs showing the reported crimes during the respectives years. 

The map of Chicago is used to display a geospatial visualization. The visualization is produced to display the total number of recorded offenses over time. There are six graphs next to the map that compare the crime rates for each year's 12 months over the course of six years (2017 - 2022). By choosing a county, the graphs are modified to solely show data for that county over the course of six years. 

Additionally, there are two buttons to select day/year at the bottom of the bar graphs. A circular heatmap view is switched to when "Day" is chosen. This graphic shows the county's crime rates over the course of a week (Sun - Mon), 24 hours a day.
